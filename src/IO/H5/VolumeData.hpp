 * \ingroup HDF5Group
 * \brief A volume data subfile written inside an H5 file.
 *
 * The volume data inside the subfile can be of any dimensionality greater than
 * zero. This means that in a 3D simulation, data on 2-dimensional surfaces are
 * written as a VolumeData subfile. Data can be written using the
 * `write_volume_data()` method. An integral observation id is used to keep
 * track of the observation instance at which the data is written, and
 * associated with it is a floating point observation value, such as the
 * simulation time at which the data was written. The observation id will
 * generally be the result of hashing the temporal identifier used for the
 * simulation.
 *
 * The data stored in the subfile are the tensor components passed to the
 * `write_volume_data()` method as a  `std::vector<ExtentsAndTensorVolumeData>`.
 * The name of each tensor component must follow the format
 * `GRID_NAME/TENSOR_NAME_COMPONENT`, e.g. `Element0/T_xx`. Typically the
 * `GRID_NAME` should be the output of the stream operator of the spatial ID of
 * the parallel component element sending the data to be observed. For example,
 * in the case of a dG evolution where the spatial IDs are `ElementId`s, the
 * grid names would be of the form `[B0,(L2I3,L2I3,L2I3)]`.  The data are
 * written contiguously inside of the H5 subfile, in that each tensor
 * component has a single dataset which holds all of the data from
 * all elements, e.g. a tensor component `T_xx` which is found on all grids
 * appears in the path `H5_FILE_NAME/element_data.vol/T_xx` and that is where
 * all of the `T_xx` data from all of the grids resides.  Note that coordinates
 * must be written as tensors in order to visualize the data in ParaView,
 * Visit, etc.   In order to reconstruct which data came from which grid,
 * the `get_grid_names()`, and `get_extents()` methods list the grids
 * and their extents in the order which they and the data were written.
 * For example, if the first grid has name `GRID_NAME` with extents
 * `{2, 2, 2}`, it was responsible for contributing the first 2*2*2 = 8 grid
 * points worth of data in each tensor dataset. Use the
 * `h5::offset_and_length_for_grid` function to compute the offset into the
 * contiguous dataset that corresponds to a particular grid.
 *
 * \warning Currently the topology of the grids is assumed to be tensor products
 * of lines, i.e. lines, quadrilaterals, and hexahedrons. However, this can be
 * extended in the future. If support for more topologies is required, please
 * file an issue.
